    Hello.
  - >-
    My name is Matt, and I like to build awesome things.

    Over the past twenty years, I have been a core member of a DARPA research
    and development group, an active duty U.S. Marine data communications chief,
    an operations and engineering director, and a key part of software engineering
    teams for companies such as MapQuest, Avery Dennison, SAIC, and others. I am
    happiest when I am solving difficult problems with excited and motivated people.
    My perfect environment is in a space where learning, experimentation, and
    pushing the envelope are core tenets, with folks who are excited about trying
    new approaches to overcoming challenges.

    In the past, I have developed software systems, large and small, in a multitude
    of languages and environments, and for a variety of platforms. I have helped
    design, build, and administer tactical IP networks that supported a wide variety
    of military units, some as small as 50-man units with extremely limited resources,
    with others as large as the entire 2nd Marine Air Wing in western Iraq's Al Anbar
    province. I have worked with developers, designers, and project managers to help
    realize a product owner's vision by defining short- and long-term development
    road maps, and by ensuring accountability of all project parties. I have led
    teams of talented software engineers, designers, and testers in fast-paced and
    dynamic environments where quality, correctness, and attention to detail were
    among the highest priorities.

    I am a geek and a hacker, but more than anything I am a guy who loves solving
    problems by building really cool things with really cool people. I would greatly
    enjoy and appreciate the opportunity to speak with you about your business and
    how we might build awesome things together. Thank you very much for your time
    and consideration; I hope to hear from you soon.
regards: All the best

      A coworker and I once built a network of private picocell GSM cellular systems,
      microwave antennas, servers-on-laptops, experimental MIMO radios, and reused
      CAT-5 cables to support 30+ DARPA-issued Android devices running combat-relevant
      applications for a military exercise. We did this out of the back of a rental
      car on top of a mountain in Yakima, Washington. It was positively fantastic.
