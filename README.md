# Matt Burton's Super-Awesome Résumé

## About

This repository contains Matt Burton's résumé, built using React and Paged.js.
The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

### First Time

Run `npm install` to install the required 3rd-party dependencies using NPM.

### NPM Scripts

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the
console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the Create React App
section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests)
for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React
in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
